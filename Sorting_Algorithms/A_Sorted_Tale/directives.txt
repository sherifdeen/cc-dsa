The owner provides the current state of the bookshelf in a comma-separated values, or csv, file. To get you
started, we have provided a function load_books, defined in utils.py.

Within script.py, we are loading the books from books_small.csv. This list of 10 books makes it easier to
determine how the algorithms are behaving. we’ll use this to develop the algorithms and then we’ll try them out
later on the larger file.

Add a for loop to print the titles within the bookshelf.
